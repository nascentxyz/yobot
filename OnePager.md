**What is Yobot?**
Yobot is a fully trustless marketplace. You can place bids, where your eth is escrowed by Yobot contracts until either:

1. A bot comes along and mints your NFT, sending it to your address and receiving the escrowed funds from the Yobot Contracts in return.
2. You cancel your order either before or after minting begins. If you are outbid, or in any case there are no NFTs available left to mint, you are still able to cancel your order and receive a full refund!

**Why Yobot?**
Yobot makes minting nfts via bots accessible to all NFT buyers, so you have the best chance at securing the art you love!
Place a bid on an NFT project before it drops and bots will compete to mint an NFT for you as soon as they become available at your specified price.
If the drop sells out before your order is filled, you can cancel your bid at any time for a full refund (minus gas)!

**Yobot won't help you buy the NFTs more cheaply than you could mint them on your own.**
Instead, it will:

- Help you be faster so you are more likely to get an NFT before they sell out. Bots can adjust gas prices and resubmit transactions faster than any user could do manually. Additionally, the Yobot team will run a flashbots-searcher bot (https://github.com/nascentxyz/yobot-searcher), so the transactions will not be frontrun since the transactions are not whispered across the mempool.
- Ensures you don't ever lose money on reverting transactions. So you can bid as high as you would as if you were gas warring by yourself, but without the risk of losing money on reverting transactions.
- Lets you bypass the project's UI. Bots can start minting and filling your orders before a project's UI is updated to start allowing purchases.
- Bypass any per-account mint limits an NFT project may have.

**What is Yobot's Roadmap?**
Yobot will soon:tm: run an experimental market for one drop to flush out any details and get community feedback.
